Project 5
Date: 12/10/18

Run the project with this command: python3 main.py


This project reads in the training json files train0.json, train1.json, ...,
train9.json and test json files test0.json, test1.json, ..., test9.json created
from the MNIST data set. At the end of training and testing, the program will
ask for a numerical input 0-9 from the user. The program will test the first
image from the respective test.json file (so input 0 will get the first image
from test0.json, etc.). It will output what it believes the input image to be
as well as all other output the program should normally have.
